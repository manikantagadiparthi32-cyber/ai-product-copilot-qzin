# AI Product Copilot – QZIN

## Overview
This project demonstrates how a Product Manager can use Artificial Intelligence
to convert unstructured user feedback into clear product insights, priorities,
and roadmaps.

The project uses synthetic but realistic user feedback data to ensure
data privacy while accurately representing real-world product challenges.

---

## Problem Statement
QZIN receives user feedback from multiple channels such as the app, website,
email, and social media. Manually analyzing this feedback is slow, subjective,
and does not scale.

Product teams struggle to answer:
- What are the top user problems?
- Which issues should be prioritized?
- How do we convert feedback into a roadmap?

---

## Solution
An AI-powered Product Copilot that:
- Analyzes voice-of-customer data
- Identifies recurring user pain points
- Prioritizes problems using the RICE framework
- Generates PRDs and product roadmaps

---

## Key Capabilities
- Sentiment analysis of user feedback
- Problem categorization (UX, Performance, Payments, Support)
- RICE-based prioritization
- AI-generated Product Requirement Documents (PRDs)
- Product roadmap creation

---

## Data
All feedback data used in this project is synthetic and created solely for
demonstration purposes. No real user data is exposed.

---

## Business Value
- Faster and unbiased product decision-making
- Reduced manual analysis effort
- Clear prioritization for engineering teams
- Leadership-ready insights

---

## Role of AI
AI is used as a decision-support system for Product Managers, not as a
replacement. It helps scale product thinking and improves consistency in
decision-making.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Executive dashboards and KPIs
- Trend analysis over time
- Integration with real feedback systems
